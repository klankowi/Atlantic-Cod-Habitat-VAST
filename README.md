Atlantic cod (_Gadus morhua_) are an ecologicaly, economically, and culturally critical part of New England's groundfish fishery. However, the fishery has been under a disaster declaration since 2012 due to historically low abundance and rapidly declining stocks. The Northeast Fishery Science Center's (NEFSC) twice-annual bottom trawl survey has been an important tool to assess groundfish stocks from Cape Hatteras, NC to Nova Scotia since the early 1960s. Through its 60+ year history, the survey has mostly sampled offshore areas deeper than 18m and with relatively smooth and soft bottom habitat. Though the survey has wide spatial and temporal coverage, there is concern among fishers that it does not adequately sample areas of high habitat complexity (cobble or boulder fields) that likely host dense populations of cod, particularly younger age classes. Many state and academic institutions conduct annual trawl surveys that may help to fill data gaps for groundfish stocks in shallower inshore waters. In 2016, the NEFSC launched a cooperative bottom longline survey to explore groundfish abundance and distribution in areas with high-rugosity bottom habitat.

The goal of this project is to build a joint index of abundance for Atlantic cod using all pertinent and available state and federal survey data. This goal will be addressed using Vector Autoregressive Spatio-Temporal (VAST) models. VAST estimates spatial density of multiple categories of a target organism conditioned on "density covariates" and controlling for "catchability covariates." We will utilize bottom habitat and rugosity data, among other habitat and environmental covarites, to explore patterns in cod habitat use. We can further examine spatial overlap between groundfish survey operations and groundfish commercial fishing operations.
